# Dice-Game-Prize-Selector-Simulation
 This project simulates a dice game prize selector using Verilog. The Main module converts six 3-bit dice inputs into six prize outputs (P1-P6). The MainTestBench module tests this design by simulating various inputs and verifying the prize outputs, highlighting digital logic and hardware simulation concepts.

# Project Files
# MainTestBench Module:

- Simulates different input combinations to test the Main module.
- Displays the prize outputs for various test cases.
- Generates a waveform file for visual analysis.

# Main Module:

- Takes six 3-bit binary inputs (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6) representing dice values.
- Outputs six signals (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6) indicating the prizes.
- Utilizes multiple submodules like Dice_Value_Decoder, Counter, and Prize_Selector to determine the prizes based on the dice values.
# CircuitVerse File
- The CircuitVerse file is an autogenerated netlist code for the dice game prize selector. It includes the following components:

# Dice_Value_Decoder Modules:
- Decode the 3-bit inputs (A, B, C) into individual signals representing dice values.
  
# Counter Modules:
- Count specific dice values and generate intermediate signals used for prize determination.

# Prize_Selector Module:
- Uses the decoded dice values and counters to determine the prize signals (P1 to P6).
- 
# Prize_2_Condition Module:
- Checks additional conditions to influence prize determination.
  
# How to Use
# Simulation:
- Use a Verilog simulator like Icarus Verilog at https://www.edaplayground.com/ to run the simulation.
- Load the Main and MainTestBench modules into the simulator.
- Observe the prize outputs for various input combinations to ensure the prize selector works correctly.

# Testing:
- The MainTestBench module runs through different dice values and prints the prize outputs.
- Compare the displayed outputs with the expected results to verify the correctness.
