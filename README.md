# Dice-Game-Prize-Selector-Simulation
 This project simulates a dice game prize selector using Verilog. The Main module converts six 3-bit dice inputs into six prize outputs (P1-P6). The MainTestBench module tests this design by simulating various inputs and verifying the prize outputs, highlighting digital logic and hardware simulation concepts.
